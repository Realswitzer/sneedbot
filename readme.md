# sneedbot
The joke is that the place is called "Sneed's Feed &amp; Seed" which is clever in itself and quite funny to those with a mature sense of humour but what's really just hilarious about it is that if you look closely at the front of this store, Sneed's Feed &amp; Seed, you can see a line that reads "Formerly Chuck's".

# What is this stupid bot about?
nothing, so far just reacts with sneedcube if "sneed"/"SNEED" is in the `message.content`.

# Are you going to make it useful?
no.

## planned features:
- large al sneed
- more reaction spam
- more opportunities to get ratelimited
