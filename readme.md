# sneedbot
The joke is that the place is called "Sneed's Feed &amp; Seed" which is clever in itself and quite funny to those with a mature sense of humour but what's really just hilarious about it is that if you look closely at the front of this store, Sneed's Feed &amp; Seed, you can see a line that reads "Formerly Chuck's".

# What is this stupid bot about?
nothing, so far just reacts with sneedcube if sneed is in the `message.content` and 1984 if a random four digit number is in `message.content`. i will not explain any of my decisions here.

# Are you going to make it useful?
no.

# Let's say I refuse to host this bot so it can be up on demand. Is there anyway to invite it?
[yes](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=945295730963271691&permissions=328768&scope=bot) although this is hosted on my machine so itll hardly be up. dont create issues complaining "hey the bot is never up!!!!" because i will close with comment telling you to host it yourself.

## planned features:
- [ ] large al sneed
- [x] more reaction spam
- [ ] more opportunities to get ratelimited
- [ ] use a stupid .env file so i dont have to worry about accidentally posting token
